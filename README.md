# simple_video_player_app

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

This is my project structure. I follow the MVVM pattern for this project. In the data section, I created methods for get and post API and handle exceptions for API calls. In model sections, I create models according to my API response, and in the repository I section I call my API. In the model-view section, I stored API data in a list and my other logical functions are here.
In the view section, I do my app UI.
