# simple_video_player_app

## Getting Started

This is my project structure. I follow the MVVM pattern for this project. In the data section, I created methods for get and post API and handle exceptions for API calls. In model sections, I create models according to my API response, and in the repository I section I call my API. In the model-view section, I stored API data in a list and my other logical functions are here.
In the view section, I do my app UI.

This is my app UI. I designed two screens here first one is for showing trending video titles, thumbnail images, durations, views, and datetime of video upload. if anyone clicks on the thumbnail then it will take him to the video play page and it will start playing the video.
